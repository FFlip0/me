            <h3>so you want to be a writer?</h3>
            <p id="poem-author">by Charles Bukowski</p>
            <p id="poem-text">
            <br>if it doesn't come bursting out of you
            <br>in spite of everything,
            <br>don't do it.
            <br>unless it comes unasked out of your
            <br>heart and your mind and your mouth
            <br>and your gut,
            <br>don't do it.
            <br>if you have to sit for hours
            <br>staring at your computer screen
            <br>or hunched over your
            <br>typewriter
            <br>searching for words,
            <br>don't do it.
            <br>if you're doing it for money or
            <br>fame,
            <br>don't do it.
            <br>if you're doing it because you want
            <br>women in your bed,
            <br>don't do it.
            <br>if you have to sit there and
            <br>rewrite it again and again,
            <br>don't do it.
            <br>if it's hard work just thinking about doing it,
            <br>don't do it.
            <br>if you're trying to write like somebody
            <br>else,
            <br>forget about it.

            <br><br>

            <br>if you have to wait for it to roar out of
            <br>you,
            <br>then wait patiently.
            <br>if it never does roar out of you,
            <br>do something else.

            <br><br>

            <br>if you first have to read it to your wife
            <br>or your girlfriend or your boyfriend
            <br>or your parents or to anybody at all,
            <br>you're not ready.

            <br><br>
            
            <br>don't be like so many writers,
            <br>don't be like so many thousands of
            <br>people who call themselves writers,
            <br>don't be dull and boring and
            <br>pretentious, don't be consumed with self-
            <br>love.
            <br>the libraries of the world have
            <br>yawned themselves to
            <br>sleep
            <br>over your kind.
            <br>don't add to that.
            <br>don't do it.
            <br>unless it comes out of
            <br>your soul like a rocket,
            <br>unless being still would
            <br>drive you to madness or
            <br>suicide or murder,
            <br>don't do it.
            <br>unless the sun inside you is
            <br>burning your gut,
            <br>don't do it.

            <br><br>

            <br>when it is truly time,
            <br>and if you have been chosen,
            <br>it will do it by
            <br>itself and it will keep on doing it
            <br>until you die or it dies in you.

            <br>there is no other way.

            <br>and there never was.
