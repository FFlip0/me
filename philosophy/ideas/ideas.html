                <h3>"every experience effects you"</h3>
                <p>as of 11/12/2024</p>
                <p>Every single thing that you have experienced has affected your life in some way. Every idea has a diffrient idea and whenever you make a decsion that is not a reflex you brain goes through every experience, emotion and idea. Every thing you have consumed in any form affects your thoughts in a daily sense. While you can not remember every thought I belive that your memories that are not worth to be remebered are rather stored as emotions that help you make decsions.</p>
                
                <h3>emotions of a young adult</h3>
                <p>as of 11/12/2024</p>
                <p>Imagine yourself as your a teen and them imagine your emotions as a thread. A single thread is a single emotion, a single idea, a single, something. Lets say that you are in total a bundle of threads, mixed of hundereds to thousands of diffrient "things." Whenever you intereact with another person your emotions and ideas converge and fight eachother. Not in a violent way but the thoughts are slowly consulted between eachother and the end result leaves the emotions that you feel for people. How you feel for diffreint people is because how your and their feeling converge, in a way. If your somehow still following, lets continue with the thread idea. When you are born, a few threads form to make your bundle, a constantly changing bundle, through everything you can feel, see, hear, think, smell. You begin to get threads and eventually start forming threads of your own. At the end of your teens your threads are often unchanged to a certain extent when before that the threads within you would change every day. Reulting in out cries and emotions and feelings all over the place, due to the constant change your body explodes in the longerm and the emotional sense. Although by your late teens to early 20s your threads are formed and non-changing ususally. You still converge with people an talk to them but it seems like you dont talk away changing anything. With the non-constant change that your body was so used to, you start to question everything. You see everything as false, you have a out-cry of emotions that are conflicting and you ultemitaley ask yourself the question, (due to tall the stress of being an 'adult' aswell and generally a 'flashing world')  "Who am I?" If you have shaped yourself around a lot of diffreint peoples emotions then who are you. I can not forsee past this as of 10/12/2024 but oh well.</p>
