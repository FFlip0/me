This repository contains a collection of my personal projects, ranging from code to digital art. The normal website is viewable [here](https://fflip0.github.io/me).

The website also contains an 'edu' folder for educational resources, which isn't currently public on the site via buttons (which I might change on a future date) but is easily viewable by clicking [here](https://fflip0.github.io/me/edu/edu.html). 

***Also cut me some slack if there are some grammar issues.***
