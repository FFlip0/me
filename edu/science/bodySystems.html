                            <p>
                            When something sudden happens to your body, your body requires a rapid response. In this case when the sensory neuron detects it, it sends it to the interneuron which instantly sends it to a motor neuron to defend yourself. Afterwards the motor neuron sends back a information report to the interneuron which sends it to the brain.
                            In this case the interneuron didn't send the signal to the brain to be processed but rather instantly sent it to a motor neuron and sends it after. Reflex arcs are a involuntary responses while critically thinking about something is a voluntary response.

                    <h3>What is the endocrine system?</h3>

                        <p>
                        The endocrine system consists of a group of glands that secrete hormones.
                        </p>

                    <h3>Hormone (Chemical Messengers)</h3>

                        <p>
                        A small chemical which causes a response in another region of the body by altering the activity of cells, this travel through the blood
                        </p>

                    <h3>Glands (Producers)</h3>

                        <p>
                        Organs that are specialised for the production and release of hormones.
                        </p>
