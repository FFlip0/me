            <h1>light</h1>
                    <h3>what is light?</h3>
                    <p>Light or light rays a one sided beams of "light" that goes indefently without object interferance. It can also be considered a ray of heat. Light rays refelct upon other items into our eyes therefore letting us see. Galaxies that are light years (how much light takes to travel in a year) are techincally in the past from earth's view due to the light not reaching the our eyes. So we see a galaxy that does not look the same from earth and actually being there.
                    </p><p>The speed of light is 299,792,458 m/s or (3 x 10<sup>8</sup>m/s), It is the fastest known speed.
                    </p>
                    <h3>mirror</h3>
                    <p>There are flat, convex and concave mirros, for know thought a mirror is a material that refelcts (bounces) light rays</p>
                <h2>reflection and refraction</h2>
                    <h3>reflection</h3>
                    <p>Reflection is the phenomenon where light bounces off a surface. 
                    </p>

                    <h3>refraction</h3>
                    <p>the change in direction of a wave passing from one medium to another caused by its change in speed
                    </p>
            
                <h2>law of reflection</h2>
                <p>The law of reflection states that the agnle of the light ray is coming into a <b>plane mirror</b> is the same angle it reflects onto on the reflected angle. The following digram illustrates this.</p>
                <image id="img2" src="media/p-LIG-AngleOfIncidence.png"></image>
                <p>Angles i and r are equal. Angle "i" is considered the "angle of incidence" while the angle of "r" is considered the angle of reflection.</p>

                <h2>concave and convex mirrors</h2>
                <p>convex mirrors are mirros that bend outwards, heres an example;</p>
                <image id="img1" src="media/p-LIG-convex.svg"></image>

                <p>concave mirrors are mirrors that bend inwards, heres an example;</p>
                <image id="img1" src="media/p-LIG-concave.svg"></image>

                                    
                    <h3>focal point</h3>
                    <p>A focal point is where all the rays interesect on a concave or convex mirror. Heres it visually.</p>
                    <image id="img2" src="media/p-LIG-focalPoint.png"></image>
                    <p>Convex mirros are a bit diffreint because the focal point (F) is where they would meet if the light rays when throught the object. (Not sure 100% about this comment.)</p>
