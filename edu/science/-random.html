                <h3>accuracy</h3>
                <p>The accuracy of an experiment is when the trend (increase/decrease/stable) of the numbers in the experiment follows the correct pattern.</p>

                <h3>precision</h3>
                <p>The precision of an experiment refers to how consistent or repeatable measurements are, regardless of whether they are close to the true value.</p>

                <h3>validity</h3>
                <p>The validity of an experiment refers to whether a measurement, experiment, or study actually measures what it claims to measure.</p>
