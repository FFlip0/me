                <p id="content-warning-1"> (this includes content from physics and chemistry.)</p>

                <p>Atoms include 3 types of subatomic particles that make up an atom:
                    <br><br>Neutron (neutral)
                    <br>Proton (positive +1)
                    <br>Electron (negative &minus;1)
                    <br><br>Neutrons are neutral meaning they have no charge, they are in the nucleus of the atom.
                    <br>Protons are positive meaning they have a positive charge (+1), they are in the nucleus of the atom.
                    <br>Electrons are negative meaning they have a negative charge (&minus;1), they are in the electron shell of the atom.
                </p>

                <h2>properties of matter</h2>

                <h3>mass</h3>
                <p>The amount of matter in an object; it is a measure of the quantity of atoms and molecules within a substance.
                </p>

                <h3>volume</h3>
                <p>The amount of space that matter occupies; it can be measured in cubic units.
                </p>

                <h3>density</h3> 
                <p>The mass of an object per unit volume; it describes how tightly packed the matter is within a given space.
                </p>

                <h3>weight</h3>
                <p>The force exerted on an object due to gravity; weight depends on mass but also on the acceleration due to gravity.
                </p>

                <h3>physical state</h3>
                <p>The state in which matter exists—solid, liquid, or gas—depending on temperature and pressure conditions.
                </p>

                <h3>melting point</h3>
                <p>The temperature at which a solid turns into a liquid.
                </p>

                <h3>boiling point</h3>
                <p>The temperature at which a liquid turns into a gas.
                </p>

                <h3>solubility</h3>
                <p>The ability of a substance to dissolve in another substance, typically in reference to a solid dissolving in a liquid.
                </p>

                <h3>conductivity</h3>
                <p>The ability of a substance to conduct heat or electricity.
                </p>

                <h3>malleability</h3>
                <p>The ability of a material to withstand deformation under compressive stress, such as being hammered or rolled into thin sheets.
                </p>

                <h3>ductility</h3>
                <p>The ability of a material to undergo significant plastic deformation before rupture or breakage, often characterised by its ability to be stretched into a wire.
                </p>

                <h2>values</h2>
                <p>
                <b>atomic Number:</b> The number of protons

                <br><br><b>atomic mass:</b> Mass of an atom (measured in amu)
                </p>

                <h2>types of matter</h2>
                    <h3>elements</h3> 
                    <p>One type of atom, pure substance. 
                        <br>e.g. O (oxygen)
                    </p>

                    <h3>molecules</h3>
                    <p>Two or more atoms chemically bonded.  
                        <br>e.g. O<sub>2</sub>, H<sub>2</sub>O 
                    </p>

                    <h3>compounds</h3> 
                    <p>Two or more atoms chemically bonded, these elements have to be diffrient not the same. 
                        <br>(Compounds are a part of molecules)
                        <br>e.g. H<sub>2</sub>O, NaCl
                    </p>

                    <h3>mixtures</h3>
                    <p>Different substances mixed together without chemical bonds but physical bonds.
                        <br>e.g. Air, Salad and Granite
                    </p>
                    
                <h2>types of atoms</h2>
                    <h3>normal</h3>
                        <p>
                        These are the normal atoms that are found on the periodic table (these are also called 'elements'). It inculdes the correct ammount of protons, neutrons and electrons.
                        </p>
                    <h3>isotopes</h3>
                        <p>
                        “Different forms of the same element.” A isotope is when a element has a different number of neutrons (of the element) but the element remains the same. Isotopes are considered the same element just as a ‘isotope’ of the element, it only changes the mass number (A) of neutrons and stability.
                        <br>An element's relative atomic mass is calculated by taking the average mass of all the element's isotopes.
                        </p>

                    <h3>ions</h3>
                        <p>
                        Every element on the periodic table have an equalling charge meaning they cancel out but when the number of protons or elections is changed, it becomes an ion. An atom can have a positive or negative charge (net charge) by which has more power (protons or electrons).
                        <br>Negatively charged ion - Anion (-ide)
                        <br>Positively charged ion - cation
                        </p>

                <h2>electron Configuration</h2>

                    <p>
                        <b>1st Shell:</b> 2
                    <br><b>2nd Shell:</b> 8
                    <br><b>3rd Shell:</b> 18
                    <br><b>4th Shell:</b> 32
                    <br><b>Valence Shell:</b> The outer most shell.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                    Usually the 3rd shell of electrons only has 8 electrons max instead of 18. This is because it needs to be stable so it fills the 4th shell and then fills the rest of the 3rd shell. Most times the 3rd shell will have a max of 8 electrons.
                    </p>
                    
                <h2>history of atoms</h2>
                    <p>we mainly use bohr's model which chadwick contributed to but it is still considered Bohr's atomic model</p>
                    <image id="img2" src="media/cp-ATM-HistoryOfAtoms.png"></image>
                    <p>there is also a quantum model but we dont need to use that</p>
