                    Questions
                    What is a wave?
                    A vibration travelling do or don't need a medium to travel through.

                    What is a median?
                    The material that air travels through (most times air)

                    What happens when it travels through a medium?
                    The wave transfers energy but it does not move the particles (medium). The particles don’t travel along the wave but they move and “jiggle” a bit. The wave itself carries the energy forward

                    Types of waves 
                    (clasmates chart)

                    (don’t worry about surface waves, not in the test)

                    Formulas
                    Speed (v)= wavelength ()  frequency (f)
                    Wavelength (λ)=speed(v)frequency 
                    Frequency (f) = Speed(v)wavelength ()
                    Period (T)= timeno. of cycles
                    Period (T) = 1frequency (f)



                    Speed is measured in metre/seconds (m/s)
                    Wavelength is measured in metre (m) 

                    Frequency is measured in hertz (Hz).  
                    Period is measured in seconds (s). 

                    Example mass (just remove the grams for any other unit) 



                    Mechanical Waves
                    Mechanical waves require a medium to travel


                    Transverse VS Longitudinal
                    The main difference between these two is that the transverse is up and down (like the wave you think of) and the longitudinal is in a line (no height) but it is compressed and expanded in certain parts.

                    Main difference is up and down versus side and side.


                    Oscillation
                    Oscillation is when a wave passes through a particle but it doesn't move when the wave passes. Here's an example

                    The duck itself doesn’t move at the end of the wave since the wave just moves through and does not exert any forces on any particle but it just moves (the duck) up and down. (It actually does exert a force on the particle/duck but in the sense of year 9 science we don't account for this to make things simpler to learn. We’ll learn about these in later years.)

                    Propagation
                    The simplest meaning is that when something propagates it moves through a medium and when it does not propagate it doesn't move through a medium (EM).



                    Transverse Waves 
                    It is a wave in which the particles of the medium vibrate perpendicular to the direction that the wave travels. For example; ripples on the surface of water, plucking a guitar string, etc. 




                    Longitudinal Waves
                    Longitudinal waves are a type of wave where the particles of the medium vibrate parallel to the direction the wave travels. In simpler terms, the particles in the medium move back and forth in the same direction as the wave propagates.

                    Mechanical Waves Properties
                    Crest 
                    The highest point of the wave. 

                    Trough
                    Lowest point of the wave. 

                    Wavelength
                    The horizontal distance between two consecutive crests/troughs

                    Amplitude
                    It refers to the intensity or strength of the wave. In a transverse wave it is how far the particles move up or down from their rest position.

                    Displacement
                    It is the change in position of an object.

                    Compression (used in longitudinal)
                    When the wave is more closer and grouped up.

                    Rarefaction (used in longitudinal)
                    When the wave is further and not grouped up.

                    Wave Height (rarely used)
                    The length between the crest and the trough

                    Finding Properties

                    (Reset Position is also known as an equilibrium)
                    One cycle is known as when the wave leaves the equilibrium touches the crest  and trough and then returns to the equilibrium. (That's one cycle)

                    Length (m) - Amplitude: The difference between the equilibrium and the crest/trough

                    Length (m) - Wavelength: Length from two crests (or any two points on two different cycles)

                    Hertz (Hz) - Frequency: The number of waves passing in one second
                    Two cycles in 8 seconds would result in 0.25 waves every seconds and that would be the frequency (0.25 Hz)

                    Period (T): The number of seconds it takes for a single wave to pass
                    
                    Speed (v): wavelength x frequency
                    Electromagnetic Spectrum (EM)
                    (This maybe not be in the test according to classmate)
                    EM waves don't need a medium but can travel through a vacuum
