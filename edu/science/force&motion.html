                <h2>definitions</h2>
                    <h3>vector quantity</h3>
                    <p>Magnitude & Direction 
                    <br>E.G: 500m, North
                    </p>

                    <h3>scalar quantity</h3>
                    <p>Value
                    <br>E.G 40kg 
                    </p>

                    <h3>magnitude</h3>
                    <p>Value or defined (quantity which you may need to find). ( usually numbers)
                    </p>

                    <h3>mass</h3>
                    <p>The matter which is the same on whatever gravity force exists on the planet (or space).
                    </p>

                    <h3>weight</h3>
                    <p>The force pulled from the gravity of the planet you are on. This may also change from which planet you are on because the gravity is different…
                    </p>
                    <h3>force</h3>
                    <p>Always force us either pull or push and it is measured by a value called “N” which stands for Newton.
                    <br>F = ma 
                    <br>m is mass, a is acceleration
                    </p>

                    <h3>motion</h3>
                    <p>If it is not being pushed or pulled by a force it is at rest but if it is being used then it is NOT at rest.
                    </p>

                    <h3>speed</h3>
                    <p>The measurement of a object and how fast it is going from point A to B speed=d/t d= distance, t = time
                    <br>E.g. 50km/h
                    </p>
                    <h3>velocity</h3>
                    <p>D/T (d = displacement, T = Time) 
                    <br>E.g. 50km/h in the east direction.
                    </p>
                    
                    <h3>displacement</h3>
                    <p>(Distance with direction) From point A to B but instead of taking left and right you are not using left and right.
                    </p>

                    <h3>acceleration</h3>
                    <p>When something is at rest or at a constant speed and it goes to a higher rate of speed which is called 'Acceleration.' (as well as time is important tosee how much time it took)
                    <br>
                    <br>v = final velocity = 10m/s   t = 5s        difference in velocity = 5m/s
                    <br>u = initial velocity = 5m/s
                    <br>
                    <br>a = v-u/t
                    <br>
                    <br>a = 10-5/5 = 5m/s2
                    </p>



                <h2>Newton's laws</h2>
                    <h3>Newton's First Law</h3>
                    <p>“An object at rest stays at rest, and an object in motion stays in motion with the same speed & same direction… UNLESS acted upon by an UNBALANCED force”
                    </p>
