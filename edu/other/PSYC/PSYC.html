            <h1>psychology</h1>
            <h2>what is psychology?</h2>
            <p>Psychology is the study of thinking not necessarily human thinking, but the thinking of all animals the brain and how it works.</p>
        
            <h2>four stages</h2>
                <h3>description</h3>
                <p>The first stage of psychology is to assess the entity you are observing. It can be an animal and is not necessarily required to be a human. In this phase, you try to describe what the person feels and thinks based on your personal observations.
                <br><br>Bias is a factor in this, and while it cannot be entirely erased, you should try to eliminate it as much as possible.
                <br><br>For example, a teacher might notice that a young girl in his second-grade classroom is behaving oddly. She's not turning in her homework, her grades are slipping badly, and she seems to have a very negative attitude toward school.</p>
                
                <h3>explanation</h3>
                <p>In this phase, you try to explain why the person does what they do. This includes determining what thoughts and ideas led to a certain action.
                <br><br>Continuing the example: To find out why the girl is behaving this way, the teacher would most likely ask the school counselor to administer some tests. Her parents might be asked to take her to a pediatrician to rule out any physical illnesses, such as an allergy. They might also take her to a psychologist for an assessment.</p>
                
                <h3>prediction</h3>
                <p>In this phase, you try to predict what the person is going to do in certain situations. If your predictions are correct, that means you have correctly explained the reasons behind their thinking.
                <br><br>Continuing the example: The psychologist or counselor would predict (based on previous research into similar situations) that this little girl will probably continue to do poorly in her schoolwork and may never be able to reach her full learning potential.</p>
                
                <h3>control</h3>
                <p>In this phase, you try to modify the person's thinking and behavior to help them improve (usually in the form of therapy).
                <br><br>Continuing the example of the young girl: There are certain learning strategies that can be used to help a child (or an adult) with dyslexia improve their reading skills. The psychologist and educators would work together to find a training strategy that works best for this particular girl.</p>
                
                <h3>...</h3>
                <p>Not all psychological investigations will use all four phases, but these four phases have been a staple in psychology for a long time.</p>

            <h2>mordern perspectives</h2>
                <p><i>as of 10/12/2024 i personally beleive in the psychodynamic perspective</i></p>

                <h3>psychodynamic perspective</h3>
                    <p>The idea that every unconscious thought and feeling plays a part in decision-making was developed by Sigmund Freud and built upon by many of his followers. It also explains how every interaction (and literally everything you have experienced) in your lifetime affects your thoughts, ideas, and decisions.
                        <br><br>In the modern day (2024), this theory is much less common than it was a few decades ago.
